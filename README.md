# No Unit Framework #

No Unit is the best unit-testing framework for the [No Code language](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode), written entirely in [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)! Initially ported from [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit), the current production release has been written with many features and support for [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode).

## Getting Started ##

Until *Noget* (the official package manager for [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)) is available to all [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode) users, start by downloading the No Unit source and including it in your solution. Reference No Unit in your test project, then write your tests in No Code:
